# Grouge

Development of the project "Artificial Intelligence: Physical-Motor Rehabilitation through games" for the Course Completion Thesis. The project is based on the creation of an Artifical Intelligence (AI) and a single player 2D game, which together will work to help rehabilitate children with disabilities.

HISTORY: The game takes place in a city called Galactica, whose life is maintained through a capsule much coveted by Grouge, the city's greatest enemy. Grouge is a goofy monster, thirsting for revenge and with a large army of monsters ready to attack what comes ahead. On one day, wanting to destroy Galactica, Grouge steals the capsule. In flight, by carelessness he breaks it, and its pieces are scattered throughout the city. In order to save everyone's life, Stella and Luis, two young extraterrestrials, were selected to go on a quest and collect the pieces and take them to the mother ship in 10 minutes, the maximum time that the city survives without its source of life . On the way they will face not only the terrible army of Grouge, but as the villain himself who will not let the city defeat him. To defend themselves, Stella and Lu√≠s have a small laser weapon and can collect shield and life activators along the way. The shield lasts for only a few seconds, just enough to protect itself from the terrible slugs thrown by Grouge's army.

HOW IT WORKS: The actions of the character in the game are made only with specific physiotherapeutic movements, related to the deficiencies: Cerebral Palsy, Ataxia and Plexus-Brachial Injury. For each movement there is a specific action. These movements are captured via Kinect, sent to an AI that verifies if the patient has performed the correct movement. If so, AI notifies the Game to activate the action that is being taken.
